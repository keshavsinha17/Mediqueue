## Overview

This Hospital Management Solution is a centralized platform designed to optimize the management of outpatient queues, bed availability, patient admissions, and inventory tracking in hospitals. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this solution aims to streamline hospital workflows, improve patient care, and facilitate city-wide healthcare integration.

## Problem Statement

Hospitals face significant operational challenges due to high patient volumes, resource constraints, and complex workflows. Key issues include:

- **Queuing in OPDs**: Long wait times and resource misallocation due to inefficient queue management.
- **Bed Availability**: Bed shortages delaying patient admissions and impacting overall hospital efficiency.
- **Admissions Management**: Cumbersome processes for admissions, transfers, and discharges.
- **Inventory Management**: Difficulty in managing medicine and consumables, leading to shortages or overstocking.
- **City-Wide Integration**: Limited data-sharing across hospitals, affecting coordinated healthcare responses.

### Requirements

- **OPD Queuing System**: Intelligent queuing and appointment scheduling to reduce wait times.
- **Real-Time Bed Management**: Tracking bed occupancy and forecasting demand for efficient patient handling.
- **Automated Admission Processes**: Streamlined protocols for admissions and discharges.
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking and automated restocking of medicines and consumables.
- **Inter-Hospital Integration**: Shared patient data and operational data across hospitals for better coordination.

## Solution Architecture

This solution is a comprehensive, modular platform that integrates multiple hospital management functionalities, with a view to future city-wide integration. It includes the following key components:

1. **Frontend (React)**: User interface for hospital staff and administrators to manage appointments, admissions, beds, and inventory.
2. **Backend (Node.js, Express)**: RESTful API handling business logic, user authentication, data processing, and integration with NIC modules.
3. **Database (MongoDB)**: Centralized storage of patient records, inventory data, and hospital resources.
4. **Real-Time Notifications**: Updates on bed availability, queue status, and inventory levels using WebSocket connections.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with the **MERN Stack**, selected for its efficiency in handling complex data transactions and real-time updates. The components include:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to manage large volumes of hospital data (patients, appointments, inventory) with flexibility and speed.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js to handle API routing, middleware, and server-side logic.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building responsive, user-friendly interfaces for hospital staff and administrators.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime to create the backend server, allowing efficient handling of concurrent connections.

## Features

### 1. OPD Queuing and Appointment Management
   - **Real-Time Scheduling**: Allows patients to book and manage appointments, reducing wait times.
   - **Dynamic Queuing**: Automatically assigns patients to available doctors based on demand and priority.

### 2. Bed Availability and Patient Admission
   - **Centralized Bed Management Dashboard**: Tracks real-time bed availability across departments.
   - **Automated Admission Protocols**: Streamlines the process for admissions, transfers, and discharges.

### 3. Inventory and Medicine Management
   - **Smart Inventory Tracking**: Real-time tracking of medicines and consumables.
   - **Automated Restocking**: Triggers restocking alerts when inventory falls below threshold levels.
   - **City-Wide Inventory Access**: Allows hospitals to view and request stock from other hospitals.

### 4. City-Wide Integration
   - **Inter-Hospital Data Sharing**: Enables sharing of patient records and resource availability for coordinated healthcare delivery.
   - **NIC Module Integration**: API-based integration with NIC modules for future expansion.
